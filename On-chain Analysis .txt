On-Chain Heuristics (Security Checks)
Mint/Freeze/Upgrade Authorities: Use a block explorer (e.g. Solscan) to check token authorities. Mint and Freeze authorities should be null (renounced) and any program upgrade key should be locked or multisig-controlled[1][2]. If developers retain these keys, they can mint or freeze tokens at will. Solscan’s token profile page explicitly shows “Authority” status (N/A if revoked) for each key[2].
Admin/Owner Keys: Ensure any contract “owner” or admin rights are renounced or held by a multisig. Tools like RugCheck flag remaining admin privileges[3]. If the team retains special upgrade or withdrawal rights, that’s a red flag.
Liquidity Pool (LP) Health: Check the size and lock status of the LP on Raydium/Orca/Pump.fun. A healthy launch usually has a sizable initial LP (e.g. at least ~$20–500k) that is locked/time-staked. Tiny LPs (<$20k) or LP tokens still in the dev wallet indicate risk[4]. If LP tokens were never sent to a time-lock contract or suddenly disappear, treat with extreme caution.
Token Distribution: Inspect holder concentration. A broad distribution (top 10 holders ≲20% of supply) is generally low-risk, whereas >50% in top addresses is high-risk[5]. Solscan’s “Holders” tab ranks wallets by balance and Solscan’s analysis dashboard summarizes holder distribution[6]. Concentrated holdings (e.g. devs or a few whales with most of the supply) enable price manipulation.
Transaction Patterns: Watch for unnatural price spikes or dumps. Rapid continuous buy pressure with no legitimate volume base, followed by a sudden crash, is a classic rug pattern[7]. Also, inspect transactions on Solscan: if sell transactions use abnormally low fees or many transfers to new addresses, suspect bots or backdoor sells.
By systematically applying these heuristics (often automated by scanners like RugCheck/SolSniffer), you can flag many scam tokens before investing. For example, RugCheck’s token analysis examines mint permissions, LP size, trading volume patterns, and holder concentration to compute a risk score[8].
Scam-Detection & Audit Tools
RugCheck (rugcheck.xyz): A Solana-focused token scanner that automates the above checks. It performs deep smart-contract scans (looking for unauthorized mint functions, hidden owner privileges) and on-chain analysis (liquidity, volume distribution, top holders)[9][8]. RugCheck flags issues like active mint keys, tiny liquidity, unlocked LP tokens, and high holder concentration, presenting an easy “traffic-light” score and alerts.
SolSniffer (solsniffer.com): A real-time auditing service that scans SPL tokens for 20+ risk indicators (mint/grant privileges, dev wallet shares, rug patterns). Each token gets a “Snifscore” and breakdown of risks. SolSniffer’s API provides detailed reports including token & LP addresses, top 50-holder breakdown, deployer info and all detected vulnerabilities[10]. It’s useful for automated vetting of many tokens.
RugWatch (Telegram Bot): An open-source bot that monitors new token mints and DEX pool creations across Solana. It applies on-chain rules (authority checks, liquidity heuristics, trading limits) and sends Telegram/Discord alerts if a launch looks risky[11]. For example, RugWatch will warn if a new Raydium pool is created but the mint key is active or LP is tiny. Using such alert bots lets you spot bad launches immediately.
De.Fi Scanner: A multi-chain audit tool (formerly DeFi Yield Scanner) that supports Solana. It scans token contracts and NFTs for vulnerabilities and flags suspicious patterns (like honeypots or backdoors). While not Solana-native, De.Fi’s broad scope can catch some scam techniques.
Other Auditors: When available, check if the project has an independent security audit (from reputable firms). Also run small test trades (or use swap simulators) to ensure tokens are not honeypots (impossible to sell).
Real-Time Data Platforms
DEXScreener (Solana section): A live charting and analytics site for Solana DEX tokens. It indexes all pools on Raydium, Orca, Meteora, Pump.fun, etc. (see the DEX filters list[12]). Dexscreener shows real-time price charts, 24h volume, transaction count, and leaderboard of trending tokens[13]. Use the “New Pairs” or “Trending” tabs to discover recent launches. Dexscreener also lets you set watchlists and alerts for price or liquidity changes.
Birdeye (birdeye.so): A token tracker that aggregates trades, charts and wallet activity on Solana (and other chains). Birdeye shows trending tokens, large trades, and whales by profit. It can follow any token by name and provides real-time trades and order-book info. (Users note that Birdeye and Dexscreener continuously scan the blockchain for new pairs[14].) Birdeye offers price alert bots (to Telegram/Discord) and a developer API for automated monitoring.
Solscan: A Solana block explorer with token analytics. On a token’s page, Solscan displays general info (supply, market cap, holders count) and an “Analysis” tab with historical price, transfer volume, and holder distribution charts[6]. The “Holders” tab lists the largest wallets. Solscan also reveals SPL token metadata and any extensions (e.g. vesting). Its profile section clearly shows the Mint/Freeze/Upgrade authority (or “N/A” if revoked)[2], making it easy to verify those security settings.
SolanaFM / Solana Beach / Step Finance: Additional explorers and dashboards. SolanaFM shows transaction activity. Step Finance is a portfolio tracker that also visualizes DEX volume and LP trends across tokens. Nansen and Corra allow smart-money analytics (tracking major wallets and their trades), though these are premium.
Trading Patterns & Signals
Buy/Sell Imbalance: Track the ratio of buys vs sells on DEX trading interfaces. A large skew (e.g. constant buys with no sellers) might indicate a buying bot or manipulative pump. Conversely, sudden heavy sells by one wallet can signal an impending dump. Dexscreener’s chart often highlights large individual trades.
Sniper & Whale Activity: On launch, sniping bots race to buy new tokens within seconds. You can sometimes spot a “sniper” purchase by looking at Solscan’s transactions: if one wallet buys almost the entire initial supply immediately, that’s a sniper. Watching top DEX trades on Dexscreener or Birdeye can reveal big buys/sells. For ongoing monitoring, use wallet-tracker bots: for example, RayBot can track any wallet or token, sending real-time Telegram alerts on large transfers or price movements[15]. This lets you follow known “whale” wallets or your own watchlist for unusual activity.
Chart Patterns: Like any trading, technical patterns apply. Watch RSI/momentum on price charts (Dexscreener and TradingView allow basic TA). Price candles with long wicks (rejections) or volume spikes often precede moves. Many traders also follow “smart money” by copying trades of veteran memecoin traders (via Telegram signals or copytrading bots like Trojan, Bloom, etc.). Use caution: these signals help with alpha spotting but can be risky if based on fluffed info.
Project Health Metrics
Liquidity Trends: Monitor total locked liquidity over time. If a project grows, its DEX pools should attract more liquidity, not fall. Dexscreener shows current LP size for each pair. A dropping LP (with no logs of adding/removing) suggests unstaking or rug.
Volume & Price Trends: Consistent trading volume (growing or stable) indicates health. Sudden volume spikes can be pump or legitimate interest. Birdeye’s “Top Volume” and Dexscreener’s trending list can highlight rising tokens. Beware of “fake volume” – check if the trades are mirrored by genuine holder interest (Solscan holder count increasing).
Holder Count & Growth: A steady rise in unique holders is usually good. Solscan’s “Holders” count (and the “Addresses” metric) shows this. If holders stagnate or a few whales dominate, that’s a concern. RugCheck and SolSniffer analyze top-holder concentration to flag this.
Social & Dev Activity (Off-Chain): Although on-chain analysis is primary, also check project GitHub/Discord activity. Frequent updates or transparent code are positives. In particular, verify that any token vesting schedules or LP-lock smart contracts are enforced.
Continuous Monitoring: Many real-time platforms have alert features. For example, Dexscreener can notify on big transactions or liquidity changes. Birdeye has a “Price bot” for custom alerts. Use these to stay informed of health metric changes.
Telegram Bots & Alert Services
RugWatch Alerts: Set up the RugWatch Telegram bot to auto-alert on risky token launches (as mentioned above)[11]. It scores new tokens in real time and posts warnings when, e.g., a fresh pair has active mint keys or tiny LP.
Wallet Tracking Bots: Use services like RayBot to follow any wallet(s) of interest. RayBot provides instant Telegram/Discord alerts for all transactions involving your tracked wallets across Solana (and other chains)[15]. You can monitor known dev wallets, listing wallets, or “smart money” wallets to copy their moves.
DEX Alerts: Most analytics platforms offer notification features. For example, Dexscreener’s watchlists can alert you when price/volume hits thresholds. Birdeye’s APIs and “Price Bot” feature can push real-time price or trade alerts. Configure these for newly tracked tokens or generic market movements (e.g. “whales are buying BONK”).
Community Channels: Finally, join key Telegram/Discord channels. There are many token-listing alert groups (e.g. “Pump.fun Alerts”, “Solana New Tokens”). These broadcast launches from Raydium, Pump.fun, etc. Always verify any tip: just because a token is listed doesn’t mean it’s safe. After hearing an alert, immediately apply the above checks (e.g. run RugCheck or inspect on Solscan). Combining telegram alerts with on-chain analysis is the most effective workflow.
By following these steps and tools – combining on-chain heuristics (authority, LP, distribution checks) with real-time analytics (Dexscreener, Birdeye, Solscan) and alert systems (RugWatch, RayBot, etc.) – you can systematically filter out scams, spot early opportunities, and monitor project health on Solana DEXs.
