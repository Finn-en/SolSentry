HypeBot is a JavaScript app that tracks hype around tokens before liquidity launches. It connects to Dexscreenerâ€™s API and LaunchLab contract addresses to fetch token metadata, activity, and early signals. Built for traders and researchers, it aims to evolve into a full-featured dashboard and mobile-ready app.
